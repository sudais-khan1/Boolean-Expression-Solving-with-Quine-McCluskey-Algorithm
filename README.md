# Boolean Expression Solver using Quine-McCluskey Algorithm

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Boolean Expression Solver project! This C++ project is designed to help users create, analyze, and solve boolean expressions using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. The project allows users to input minterms or Karnaugh maps and generates truth tables along with simplified boolean expressions.

## Features

1. **Minterm and Karnaugh Map (K-map) Entry:**
   - Users can input minterms or K-maps to create boolean expressions.

2. **Truth Table Generator:**
   - The project allows users to generate truth tables based on the entered minterms or K-maps.

3. **Quine-McCluskey Algorithm:**
   - The core of the project utilizes the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to simplify and solve boolean expressions.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file.
5. Enter number of literals and input minterm or kmap.

## Usage

1. Select the appropriate input method:
   - **Minterms:** Enter minterms separated by commas.
   - **Karnaugh Map (K-map):** Enter K-map values (0 or 1) separated by spaces.

2. The tool will display the simplified Boolean expression or the truth table.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

Happy boolean expression solving!
